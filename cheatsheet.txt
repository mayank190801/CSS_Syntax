--- SELECTORS ---
- Rarely ID's should be used -- in css
- h1, h2  --- this applies to all h1 and h2
- h1 h2 --- this applies to all h2 inside h1
- classes help in giving us more freedom specifity -- (prefer more)
- * { }  -- selects all the elements 
- Works like a waterfall -- css basically works on inheritance + the last rule is applied 
- Not everything is inherited -- font rules are inherited, but so are border and all are not applied
- forms elements do not inherit font -- (font : inherit) specially alloted
- id > class > element (SPECIFITY)
